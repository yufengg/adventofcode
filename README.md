# 2020 Advent of Code
(in Python)

Yet another repo of solutions. 

BUT!

This one has a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMUdwhLW7A0gsVHeuh-sQ_DefsrgWlr2I) to go it with it ... so yay?? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Goals

I'm generally using tooling that is accessible to beginner to intermediate Python programmers, and not trying to be "clever" or write extra-short source code. Instead, I'm trying to write readable, maintainable, and understandable code, that doesn't try to do anything "fancy".

* Lack of fanciness is not guaranteed, however it will (probably) be at leasted commented (eventually).
